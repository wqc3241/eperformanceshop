 == Frequently Asked Questions ==
 
 = Do I need this plugin =
 
 If your state requires taxes to be calculated by zip code "If different zip codes in your state have different rates" then yes this will save you a lot of time. 
 
 = Woocommerce standard tax rate page is taking a long time to load or causing timeout errors =
 This isnt a problem with the plugin, it can take a long time to populate woocommerce tax page with thoasands of rates. As the woocommerce tax page is trying to populate the page with all of your rates so some times the woocommerce settings page will time out. This has no effect on the checkout page though.
